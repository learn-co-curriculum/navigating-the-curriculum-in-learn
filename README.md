## Overview
The Learn education platform was launched in 2015, built around three core ideas: 

* **Real tools** – to ensure students are prepared for data science roles by using the tools and workflows that data scientists use on the job; 
* **Open curriculum** – to ensure what we’re teaching you is always relevant by integrating real-time feedback from instructors and our community; and
* **Community** – to make sure that while you are learning online, you’re not alone. 

Learn is designed for people who are passionate, curious, self-driven, and absolutely serious about learning to do data science. 

Most people on Learn have already been exploring data science by using the amazing and plentiful resources all around the Internet. However, in developing the content on Learn, we designed it for beginners. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, ask for help and an instructor will be glad to help.

This program will demand that you be patient, resilient, resourceful, and gritty. Isn't that the kind of person you want to be? We think that's the kind of person you already are. The curriculum you'll encounter is rigorous. We don't dumb anything down because we believe in your infinite capacity to learn.

## Tracks
A curriculum "track" is a collection of many lessons and labs, organized into topics. Clicking on the name of the track will open Track Navigation, which allows you to view topics and move between lessons. As a student in the Online Data Science program, you’ll be completing the Data Science Career Modules 1-5 tracks.

## Lessons + Labs
Each Module contains Sections, which are a collection of lessons and labs. Later lessons and labs build off the earlier ones, so it is strongly advised that you complete each lesson or lab before you advance to the next one. Use the navigation to go back and review earlier content if needed.

Lessons and labs you've completed will be filled in with a green circle, and your current lesson or lab will be orange. You can always view your total lessons and labs completed on your Learn profile page.

* **Lessons**: Lessons have instructional content and are designed to teach you something without challenging you to practice or implement the concept directly. Lessons provide context and exposure to a topic by breaking concepts down. Lessons are how you learn enough to solve a lab.
* **Labs** : Labs will require you to write code. All labs include a Jupyter Notebook that you will see on Learn. The Jupyter Notebook will describe the objectives, overview, and instructions for the code you must write in the text cells, and you’ll be prompted to enter and try out your code in the code cells.

Note that you're going to have to do a lot of reading on Learn. We believe that with all the details and syntax involved in code, the best way to learn to code is through reading and writing code, not relying too heavily on watching videos.

Once you've completed a lesson or lab, you should click the "I'm Done" button on the right-hand side of your screen. The "Next Lesson" button will light up, allowing you to proceed. Clicking “I’m Done” also marks that lesson as complete so you receive credit for it.
